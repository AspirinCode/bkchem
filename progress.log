RELEASE 0.8.1
----------------------------------------

 * bugfixes - usage of context menu under windows no longer causes hanging
            - crash under windows on bkchem exit fixed
            - not finished "free rotation around single bond" in transformation mode was removed




RELEASE 0.8.0
----------------------------------------

 * bugfixes - unneeded import causing dependency on the XMLplus package was removed




RELEASE 0.8.0-pre2
----------------------------------------

 * bugfixes - when multiple filenames were given from the command line, only the existence
              of the first was properly checked
            - some triple bonds were not exported correctly into SVG
            - "As-is" text interpretation did not work proprly for atoms
            - bond and mark positioning was reduntandly recalculated after 2D rotation
            - error was triggered by closing a tab with an item focused
            - after moving items via arrow keys some atoms were inactive for some time
            - it is not possible to save a file under a name of already opened file anymore
            - repositioning of marks is not called on all marks after deletion of something
              (it was really annoying)
            - when a standard value for font size was != 12 and some text had font size == 12 it
              was rescaled to the standard value on rereading of the file (the font size was not saved)
            - undo of marks was fixed (they were sometimes not deleted on undo) 


 * enhancements - some wrapper methods enable now non-ascii characters input on much wider
                  set of systems
                - chemical meaning of all marks (except the lone electron pair) is now taken into account
                - context menu bound to the right mouse key was added (thus the previous functionality
                  of the right key was moved to the middle key)
                - INChI can be generated via an external INChI program (the capabilities are limited to
                  the capabilities of the Molfile export plugin)
                - window geometry is saved and restored on next start (with a slight, strange shift in case of
                  some window managers)
                - svg export of wedges was fixed for bonds with line-width != 1.0
                - atom mode added to enable creation of sigle-atom molecules
                - marks on selected atoms can be moved via arrow keys in mark mode (select the atom, go to the
                  mark mode and use the arrow keys to move the marks), it is a quick addition that will be
                  hopefully enhanced in the next release
                - reaction mode was added (you can define the reactants, products etc. for each arrow)
                - equithick hatch bonds were introduced and made default (you can change it by clicking on the
                  bond more than once), this is because it is recommended as sharp hatch bonds are usually
                  wrongly interpreted. Thanks to Michal Bozon for the patch
                - CH2OH group was added
                - INChI reading was updated to version 1.12Beta (older version is also supported)
                - INChI reading of molecules with movable H atoms was fixed
 

 * changes - Name mode was removed, Menu/Object/Set molecule name (ID) was introduced instead
           - the keybindings were changes so that using a-zA-Z characters have the same effect
             as the Space character, thus you can start to type directly without pressing Space first
           - because of the previous point, all keybindings now contain a Ctrl or Alt in every part
             (C-o b => C-o C-b)
           - atom text could be no longer edited in the text mode, use atom mode instead
           - the organization of buttons in menu was slightly changed


 * acknowledgments - to Michal Bozon for the equithick patch



----------------------------------------
RELEASE 0.8.0-pre1

 * bugfixes - text created by copying disappeared from the saved file (and corrupted it)
              (the corrupted files are now read and the lost text is marked with ? mark)
            - some double bond did not respond to shift-clicking to reposition the second line
            - size of arrow-heads in SVG export was fixed for arrows thicker than 1px
            - when using the "As-is" button for atom text change, the text is now always diplayed
            - when focused atom was removed by undo a bug was triggered
            - oasa - reading of smiles such as C1CccCC1 was corrupted 

 * enhancements - support for multiple files was added
                - it is possible to copy objects from one file to another

              placed over some other object with full backgroung

 * enhancements - \n in text entry is translated to new-line
                - undo of molecule division was optimized (leading to 10-100x shorter times for large molecules)
                - reading of CDML files was optimized
                - some redundant informations are saved into CDML files to speed the reading up
                - template addition was optimized (speedup of 10-100x for large molecules)
                - deletion of parts of molecules was optimized (up to 10x speedup for larger molecules)

                  started to work on this year. It brings support for several chemical formats.
                  At this time SMILES, Molfiles and IChI (only reading). To be able to use
                  these features you have to have at least Python 2.3.
                  - Molfiles - export, import
                  - IChI - direct input (see the menu Chemistry)
                  - SMILES - direct input, ouput (see the menu Chemistry)

             it was added to (by means of bond)
           - permissions fixed so that templates.cdml is readable for everybody

* enhancements - bond order is cycled only within limits of free valency of neighbor atoms
               - OH and similar groups ("protonated atoms") change the number of Hs on bond
		 addition, deletion and undo

* changes - hitting 'Space' when only single text (atom) is selected sets the default text for
            edit to this particular text, the last entered text (the old way) is used only when
            more items are selected




----------------------------------------
RELEASE 0.6.0-pre1

                - hints on usage appear now in status bar when you change a mode
                - double click in edit_mode selects the whole molecule
                - cyclopentadiene template was updated to be really symmetric

-- release of 0.5.1-pre1

2004-02-10  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav4)

	* bugfix - an ugly bug that caused focus circles to hang around when a delete operation was
		   performed with an atom (or other item) in focus.
	* bugfix - annoying warnings about "leaving NONE" were fixed in arrow mode

	* the points of spline arrow are no more visible. You can click the arrow to get the points
	  selected to see them (let me know if this does not suit you)
	* in the arrow mode you can now choose if you want do create a spline arrow or a normal one.
	  The selected type of arrow is also applied if you modify the arrow or simply click on it.


2004-02-09  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav3)

	* bugfix - a config dialog bug caused by Python 2.3 introduction of boolean type was fixed
	* bugfix - an error when configuring an arrow ("config dialog has no attribute spline_changed")
		   was fixed
	* bugfix - several redundant and baseless roundings of coordinates were removed
		   (thanks to Michal Bozon for the patch)
	* bugfix - the cyclopentane template was updated which makes it (together with the
		   previous bugfix) 100% symmetric
		   (thanks to Michal Bozon for the patch)

	* the [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene :) template was removed
	* in the standard dialog it is now possible to specify if all the standard values should be
	  applied or only the changed ones.


2004-02-08  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* bugfix - rotation mode no longer creates empty undo records when no rotation was performed


2004-02-06  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav2)

	* bugfix - a typo that made the superscript button create subscript was fixed
	* bugfix - wedge arrow with non-black color goes no more black after focus
	* bugfix - the marks are now repositioned during rotation (after rotation for 3D rotation)


2004-02-04  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav1)

	* bugfix - "Unable to parse text..." error was found and fixed. May this be caused by the
	  	   unicode usage under RedHat? (I have not seen this under Gentoo)
	
	* code cleanup - the undo was switched to meta-info driven code which should make the code
	  		 more easily extendable
	* code cleanup - the bond draw method was switched to "plugable methods" code, this should
	  		 also save much work when new bond types are added 


2003-10-01  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* bugfix - problem with bond width change was fixed



-- release of 0.5.0

2003-09-30  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* PostScript export updated to support paper sizes and moved to a plugin (File/Export/Encapsulated PostScript)

-- release of 0.5.0-pre5

2003-09-26  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* it is now possible to save your personal standard (from the Options/Standard dialog)
	  which will be used everytime you start BKchem
	* templates for common five membered heterocycles added (thanks to Petr Vodicka for them)
	* templates for purine and chair conformation of cyclohexane were added
	* bugfix - OpenOffice Draw export supports text color
	* bugfix - in SVG export sometimes overlay of items did not correspond to their order in bkchem
	* bugfix - it seems that Tkinter treats font sizes as if they were in 'px' not 'pt' as it states.
		   The SVG generation code was fixed to output 'px' so that the SVG export is more WYSIWYG
		   (please let me know if you find the SVG text significantly smaller than what you see in BKchem) 

2003-09-25  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* use of standard values significantly improved
	* dialog for standard values added
	* second bond of double and triple bonds may be drawn shorter than the main part of the bond

-- release of 0.5.0-pre3

2003-07-21  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* a nasty bug (in fact bad coding habit) that caused saving files to crash on machines with
	  PyXML installed was fixed. BKchem should be now fully compatible with the PyXML library.


-- release of 0.5.0-pre2

2003-07-17  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* templates are scaled according to the standard bond length

2003-07-06  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* bkchem now deals with abbreviated alkyl chains (CnH2n+1) as with other groups
	  (expansion, molecular formula etc.) 
	* support for b-spline arrows was added, unfortunately SVG can deal only with Bezier curves
	  and don't know how to transform b-spline -> Bezier; this means the export to SVG is far from perfect 
	* bugfix - appending a template to an atom with non-zero Z coordinate did not work properly;
	           code was added to detect such cases and inform the user that it is not possible

2003-07-02  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* standard bond length was changed from pixels to cm, so that it is machine independent
	* 'C-d n' where 'n' is number in range 2-9 appends an aliphatic chain to the focused atom

	  - files should now look exactly the same on different machines

2003-05-24  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* sizes in SVG export were normalized;
	  files should look exactly the same on machines with different dpi resolution

2002-12-23  Beda Kosata	<kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* buttons for text tagging added - selected text can be tagged (b, i, sub, sup) during editing using buttons.
