-- release of 0.5.1-pre1

2004-02-10  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav4)

	* bugfix - an ugly bug that caused focus circles to hang around when a delete operation was
		   performed with an atom (or other item) in focus.
	* bugfix - annoying warnings about "leaving NONE" were fixed in arrow mode

	* the points of spline arrow are no more visible. You can click the arrow to get the points
	  selected to see them (let me know if this does not suit you)
	* in the arrow mode you can now choose if you want do create a spline arrow or a normal one.
	  The selected type of arrow is also applied if you modify the arrow or simply click on it.


2004-02-09  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav3)

	* bugfix - a config dialog bug caused by Python 2.3 introduction of boolean type was fixed
	* bugfix - an error when configuring an arrow ("config dialog has no attribute spline_changed")
		   was fixed
	* bugfix - several redundant and baseless roundings of coordinates were removed
		   (thanks to Michal Bozon for the patch)
	* bugfix - the cyclopentane template was updated which makes it (together with the
		   previous bugfix) 100% symmetric
		   (thanks to Michal Bozon for the patch)

	* the [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene :) template was removed
	* in the standard dialog it is now possible to specify if all the standard values should be
	  applied or only the changed ones.


2004-02-08  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* bugfix - rotation mode no longer creates empty undo records when no rotation was performed


2004-02-06  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav2)

	* bugfix - a typo that made the superscript button create subscript was fixed
	* bugfix - wedge arrow with non-black color goes no more black after focus
	* bugfix - the marks are now repositioned during rotation (after rotation for 3D rotation)


2004-02-04  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org> (sav1)

	* bugfix - "Unable to parse text..." error was found and fixed. May this be caused by the
	  	   unicode usage under RedHat? (I have not seen this under Gentoo)
	
	* code cleanup - the undo was switched to meta-info driven code which should make the code
	  		 more easily extendable
	* code cleanup - the bond draw method was switched to "plugable methods" code, this should
	  		 also save much work when new bond types are added 


2003-10-01  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* bugfix - problem with bond width change was fixed



-- release of 0.5.0

2003-09-30  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* PostScript export updated to support paper sizes and moved to a plugin (File/Export/Encapsulated PostScript)

-- release of 0.5.0-pre5

2003-09-26  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* it is now possible to save your personal standard (from the Options/Standard dialog)
	  which will be used everytime you start BKchem
	* templates for common five membered heterocycles added (thanks to Petr Vodicka for them)
	* templates for purine and chair conformation of cyclohexane were added
	* bugfix - OpenOffice Draw export supports text color
	* bugfix - in SVG export sometimes overlay of items did not correspond to their order in bkchem
	* bugfix - it seems that Tkinter treats font sizes as if they were in 'px' not 'pt' as it states.
		   The SVG generation code was fixed to output 'px' so that the SVG export is more WYSIWYG
		   (please let me know if you find the SVG text significantly smaller than what you see in BKchem) 

2003-09-25  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* use of standard values significantly improved
	* dialog for standard values added
	* second bond of double and triple bonds may be drawn shorter than the main part of the bond
	  (the ratio is customizable via Options/Standard or in config dialog for every bond)
	  Thanks to Michal Bozon for the original patch.
	* all button images were converted to gifs in order to preserve their transparency

2003-09-21  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

-- release of 0.5.0-pre4

2003-07-22  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* the same fix as in 0.5.0-pre3 for all the plugins (the statement about full compatibility
	  of 0.5.0-pre3 with PyXML should be now more valid :)


-- release of 0.5.0-pre3

2003-07-21  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* a nasty bug (in fact bad coding habit) that caused saving files to crash on machines with
	  PyXML installed was fixed. BKchem should be now fully compatible with the PyXML library.


-- release of 0.5.0-pre2

2003-07-17  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* templates are scaled according to the standard bond length

2003-07-06  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* bkchem now deals with abbreviated alkyl chains (CnH2n+1) as with other groups
	  (expansion, molecular formula etc.) 
	* support for b-spline arrows was added, unfortunately SVG can deal only with Bezier curves
	  and don't know how to transform b-spline -> Bezier; this means the export to SVG is far from perfect 
	* bugfix - appending a template to an atom with non-zero Z coordinate did not work properly;
	           code was added to detect such cases and inform the user that it is not possible

2003-07-02  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* standard bond length was changed from pixels to cm, so that it is machine independent
	* 'C-d n' where 'n' is number in range 2-9 appends an aliphatic chain to the focused atom

	  - files should now look exactly the same on different machines

2003-05-24  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

	* sizes in SVG export were normalized;
	  files should look exactly the same on machines with different dpi resolution

2003-05-21  Beda Kosata	<beda@zirael.org>

2003-02-02  Beda Kosata	<kosatab@vscht.cz>

		   failed because valency information for that atom are not available at read.

2002-12-23  Beda Kosata	<kosatab@vscht.cz>

	* buttons for text tagging added - selected text can be tagged (b, i, sub, sup) during editing using buttons.
