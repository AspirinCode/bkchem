NOTE: Starting with the version 0.9.0-pre1 I ship piddle sources together with
bkchem. Piddle is a library provided under the GPL license and seems to be dead
to at least 2 years. Therefore I have decided to put it inside bkchem sources and
distribute any eventual additions this way. I case I will make any major changes
I will release piddle as a standalone library.
