NOTE: Starting with the version 0.9.0-pre1 I ship piddle sources together with
bkchem. Piddle is a library provided under the GPL license and seems to be dead
at least 2 years. Therefore I have decided to put it inside bkchem sources and
distribute any eventual additions this way. In case I will make any major changes
I will release piddle as a standalone library.

NOTE: Starting with the version 0.10.0-pre1 I ship Pmw (http://pmw.sourceforge.net/)
sources (version 1.2) together with bkchem. 
I had to make some minor fixes in Pwm and as it is a library provided under the GPL
license and seems to be dead I have decided to put it inside bkchem sources and
distribute the fixed version this way.

NOTE: I bundle the official InChI software from IUPAC in a binary form together
with BKChem in my Windows binary builds. All the credit for this nice piece of
software goes to its creators.
