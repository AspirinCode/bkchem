remarks

- why is in fact in modes:369 "if not self._dragging"? then we need to add a different enter_object
  method to arrow mode to get rid of the annoying warnings which are caused by unsymmetrical enter-leave
  calls.
- make use of get_submode() in modes


0.6.0
=======


new bond types -
	- when a single bond is clicked with triple selected it should convert to triple
	- remake toggle_type
	- select and focus must be updated as new types are added
	- for multiple wedge or hatch - use line_width = wedge_width and bond_width = bond_width?

- mode for ring creation


- vertical and horizontal swap
  - double bonds
  - not containers
- meta infos - is_container
	- distinguish between container as molecule and containers as all top level classes
	- is simple?
	- if not simple then what is under, wow. - via get_shape_defining_children()
- 60, 120 etc. fixed rotation
- keybindings customization?

- could be even possible to make a new parent for those who have a line_width property,
  they have a common read_standard_values()


- code cleanup!
  - yes|no in get_package
  - distance, bond_width etc. in xml
  - widgets for paper properties selection
- do something with pixmaps and their fucked behaviour of not working when imported on the top of the file
  - needs some proper module initiation?
- translate italic, bold etc. in editPool
- implement the method swapping?
- spline - svg, exports - HOW? the SVG does not know b-splines
- marks and the real coords, plus and real coords - drop real coords and make importers scale the drawing? what about CML output?
  (what about to map A=cm?!?)
?- widths and px->cm
- prepare a way to reuse the same group drawing for different names (CH3, Me)
- edit_pool should be able to come in a mode that disables the B,I etc. (for naming)
- find a way to box related button groups together
- when the doc is propagating through as a method argument why not use it for something else?
- hatch step size
?- min and max values on change of unit
?- somehow hide the visible points of arrow
!- text showing the progress of drag, resize etc.
?- font and others stored also on molecular level in order to provide values for new atoms and bonds?
- bold, unbold with C-t b
?- rename colors in xml?
- no repositioning on template add
- make standard child of object and use the properties for access to its attrs in order to make the str->int transform?

0.6.0

- scaling by means of dragging of the corner? - vector mode?
- dialogs on separate tab?
- pasting text directly from clipboard to a text object
- styles? at least as default values
- metainformation on class level
- always appended new atoms transoid at first
- code to round coordinates after rotation, template tranform etc. - classes.py:742
	- is it realy good for something?
- use the same background color on every platform
?- make Cn (C6 etc.) also a valid group such as C6H13?
- template groups
- split paper to several layers
- split classes to several files (and layers?)
- split data and text (data.py)


0.x.0

BUGS - config dialog could be forgotten by the user under the main window, should be 'real modal'

- separate stereo flags from s,d,t (in both CDML and drawing)
- concatenation should prefer to save show-atoms
-rework CDML (split chemistry, graphics, data), create styles?
 - distance in bond could be a problem - is it always set?, what if i set it to a single bond and then reload the file?!!?
 -is "bond width" the right name for the second line distance?!?
 -switch all coords info to points?
 -CDML reading associated with each class is no longer sustainable?
 - data are put directly to their owners
- new molecules made from old are put to the top of the stack
- should resizing of molecules (and arrows etc.) be possible in vector mode?
- using paper.selected together with arrows and polygons could be painful - try to rewrite the selection code
  to select the whole parent if all children are selected (and unselect the children). This could be also useful for molecule selection.
- preferences?
- unescape text when going to edit it


0.6.0

- adding data to individual items according to SelfML? Could be cool!
- rotated rect and oval - how?!!
?- the positioning of charges could be adjustable together with yes|no
?- standard bond length should be adjusted according to mean bond length of imported molecule
?- circle searching could count atoms and prefer six membered rings


0.7.0

- reaction description - no mapping
- atom mapping
