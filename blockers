remarks

- why is in fact in modes:369 "if not self._dragging"? then we need to add a different enter_object
  method to arrow mode to get rid of the annoying warnings which are caused by unsymmetrical enter-leave
  calls.
- make use of get_submode() in modes
- why does _decide_distance_and_center compute bond_width from length? It should take it from the standard
- focus circle is positioned strangely on freestyle arrow drawing
- cleanup - all things that have to be updated after bond deletion, addition etc. should be 
	put to one place. Where?
- what about the dpi problem on windows?


0.7.0
=======

- never center the 'whab' double bonds?

- move using arrows is not finished by concatenation of molecules
  (- pri konectu pomoci sipek (konekt byl vyvolanej kreslenim pote) se vazba neexportovala do OO
	(reload a reexport pomoh))

- check permission denied on plugin output
- michal reported something with colors and OH?
- should I use the C-x c ?  self.register_key_sequence( 'C-x c', self.app.paper.toggle_center_for_selected)

FOR MULTIPLE PAPERS

- the saving is a mess
- standard should be read on paper creation, the sizes should not be given by app
- move load_file to paper?
- name should be set directly to the filename - not untitled
- do not open files twice
- copying between files, clipboard is persistent


0.x.0
=======

- vertical and horizontal swap - for all
- remove the name mode and make it accessible through the menu
- bond drawing could be much simplified by e.g.- draw_order( order, line_drawing_method=draw_wedge)
- it should be possible to make bond.item always an invisible line and put rest into one list

- think about how to make selecting of the whole molecule by means of a rectange

- mode for ring creation?

- meta infos - is_container
	- distinguish between container as molecule and containers as all top level classes
	- is simple?
	- if not simple then what is under, wow. - via get_shape_defining_children()
- 60, 120 etc. fixed rotation
- keybindings customization?

- code cleanup!
  - yes|no in get_package
  - widgets for paper properties selection
- translate italic, bold etc. in editPool
- spline - svg, exports - HOW? the SVG does not know b-splines
- marks and the real coords, plus and real coords - drop real coords and make importers scale the drawing? what about CML output?
  (what about to map A=cm?!?)
?- widths and px->cm
- prepare a way to reuse the same group drawing for different names (CH3, Me)
- edit_pool should be able to come in a mode that disables the B,I etc. (for naming)
- hatch step size
?- min and max values on change of unit
?- somehow hide the visible points of arrow
!- text showing the progress of drag, resize etc.
?- font and others stored also on molecular level in order to provide values for new atoms and bonds?
- bold, unbold with C-t b
?- rename colors in xml?
- no repositioning on template add

0.6.0

- scaling by means of dragging of the corner? - vector mode?
- dialogs on separate tab?
- pasting text directly from clipboard to a text object
- metainformation on class level
- always appended new atoms transoid at first
?- make Cn (C6 etc.) also a valid group such as C6H13?
- split paper to several layers
- split data and text (data.py)

- concatenation should prefer to save show-atoms
- new molecules made from old are put to the top of the stack
- using paper.selected together with arrows and polygons could be painful - try to rewrite the selection code
  to select the whole parent if all children are selected (and unselect the children). This could be also useful for molecule selection.
- unescape text when going to edit it


- adding data to individual items according to SelfML? Could be cool!
- rotated rect and oval - how?!!
?- the positioning of charges could be adjustable together with yes|no
?- circle searching could count atoms and prefer six membered rings
